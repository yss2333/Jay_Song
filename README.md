## About

Hello,
welcome to my portfolio. I'm Jay! I am a senior undergraduate and pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Statistics (Pennsylvania State University), majoring in statistical data analytics and minoring in Mathematics and Information Sciences and Technology. As an undergraduate studying data analysis, I have gained a strong foundation in statistical methods and programming skills. I am proficient in the use of the R programming language, which I have used extensively in my previous projects to analyze large and complex datasets. I am also familiar with SQL and have experience working with databases. I am excited to continue developing my skills and apply them to real-world problems. In addition, I have experience using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool that I have used to create interactive dashboards and reports to communicate complex insights in an easy-to-understand manner.

My expertise in these tools, combined with my attention to detail and ability to think critically, allows me to tackle complex problems and provide insightful solutions. I am confident in my ability to work with various datasets, perform statistical analysis, and effectively communicate the results to a variety of stakeholders. Whether working with internal teams or communicating with faculties, I always aim to deliver clear, concise, and actionable insights. Overall, my GitHub portfolio showcases a variety of projects I have worked on, including data cleaning and visualization, predictive modeling, and data analysis. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and work on data-driven projects.

## Data-EDA & Statistical Analysis Projects:
    
   + <a href="Study Projects/Statistical Investigation & Data Analysis.pdf"> Social Media Usage Analysis </a>: 
        To determine the effect of social media usage on studentsâ€™ academic performance and mental health according to various factors which gives an insight about the statistical analysis using <b>R</b>.
   + <a href="Study Projects/Regression Modeling Project - Real Estate Sales.pdf"> Real Estate Sales Analysis </a>: To analyze the data on real estate to predict the house price and identify a relationship between various factors and the sale price of houses using <b>R</b>.
   + <a href="Study Projects/Regression_Modeling_Analysis.pdf"> Regression Modeling </a>: This project contains three different datasets.
	
	1. Property Valuation and Assessment: To analyze the relationship between the selling price and the assessed valuation of one-family residential dwellings in a large tax district using R.
	
	2. County Demographic Information (CDI): To analyze county demographic information of 440 of the most populous counties in the United States. Using various variables in the dataset, such as the County, State, Land area, Total population, Percent of population aged 18-34, Percent of population 65 or older and Number of active physicians, I studied how the variables affect the number of active physicians using R.
	
	3. Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control: To analyze the data and determine whether infection surveillance and control programs have reduced the rates of nosocomial infection in the United States hospitals using R.
