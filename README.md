# Sejun Song - Data Analysis Projects Portfolio #


## About

Hello,
welcome to my portfolio. I'm Sejun(Jay)! I am a senior undergraduate and pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Statistics (Pennsylvania State University), majoring in statistical data analytics and minoring in Mathematics and Information Sciences and Technology. As an undergraduate studying data analysis, I have gained a strong foundation in statistical methods and programming skills. I am proficient in R, and have experience using data visualization libraries such as ggplot and Tableau. I am also familiar with SQL and have experience working with databases. I am excited to continue developing my skills and apply them to real-world problems. My GitHub portfolio showcases a variety of projects I have worked on, including data cleaning and visualization, predictive modeling, and data analysis. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and work on data-driven projects.
